This is a present to my brother.

He enjoys coding and sharing his work on Twitch.tv
The issue lies in him not being the best editor or having the time to edit.


The aim --> Make longer form content(+60 min) to shorter videos that can be uploaded.

In the first iteration of the code i aim to make shorts(60 s) clips from his streams, 
before aiming for full youtube videos(+10 min).

The challenge --> Defineing what content in the stream is worth repurposeing


How do i define worth? currently i havent figured it out leading into the next question. 
What does the market do? Currently the market extracts the audio from the videos, which is then analysed by a language model.
Using an Openai model and defining a prompt may be a resonable solution.

The limitations i have encountered while searching for this solution prior to determining that i would 
code it myself are:

Web Applications Only - All current solutions are web applications. I havenâ€™t found any desktop applications that offer the features I need.
Slow Processing Time - During testing, I noticed that one of the web apps had a very long processing time.
Audio-Only Content Analysis - The current web apps analyze content using audio only.
Output Video Length Limit - The current web apps have a maximum output video length of 3 minutes.
Cost - Subscribtion service with tiered system.


Journal entry 1 - The long proccessing time when downloading video occurs when downloading from youtube using a link.
                  Anothor point to think about is dimention sizing. Videos on youtube are generally 16:9 and short are generally 9:16
                  
                  The aim currently is to seperate the video into chapter segments based on the videos timestamps before thinking
                  about content analysis. Call it iteration 1!
